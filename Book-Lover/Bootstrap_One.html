    <h1>Book Lover Project</h1>
    <p>Welcome to your Bootstrap Project: Book Lover</p>
    <p>You will recreate this webpage and an additional Form Page</p>
    <p>Just follow the instruction steps here to re-create these webpages!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a general landing page with a JumboTron</li>
      <li>Next create a NavBar on the Page that links to another html file</li>
      <li>Add two paragrahs of lorem-ipsum below the jumbotron</li>
      <li>Next use the Grid system to add in thumbnail pictures of coffee. Source: https://stocksnap.io/search/book You will need to use the thumbnail class for this. Here are the image links:</li>
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://cdn.stocksnap.io/img-thumbs/280h/QZ4ZKZZNMM.jpg">One</a> </li>
          <li> <a href="https://cdn.stocksnap.io/img-thumbs/280h/YYJBMNVN6Q.jpg">Two</a> </li>
          <li> <a href="https://cdn.stocksnap.io/img-thumbs/280h/UVRPTGPNJ2.jpg">Three</a> </li>
          <li> <a href="https://cdn.stocksnap.io/img-thumbs/280h/vintage-sewing_E6IP9VDDDM.jpg">Four</a> </li>
          <li> <a href="https://cdn.stocksnap.io/img-thumbs/280h/4BR2JDSSA1.jpg">Five</a> </li>
          <li> <a href="https://cdn.stocksnap.io/img-thumbs/280h/UCQ9L7TMME.jpg">Six</a> </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Next make sure that at the largest settings you have 3 columns of pictures. On the smallest screen settings you should have 2 columns. Its up to you where you want to change.</li>
        <li>Next create another html file for the sign up page</li>
        <li>Create a Form on this Sign Up page with Email, Password, and a Check Box</li>
      </ol>
      <p>That's it. Feel free to play around with this project and style it more to your liking. The main focuses of this project are the uses of NavBar, Jumbotron, Form, Container, and the Grid System</p>

      <p>A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.[1] The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its immediate predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page.</p>
      <p>As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and a still considerable, though not so extensive, investment of time to read. This sense of book has a restricted and an unrestricted sense. In the restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage that reflects the fact that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls, and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. So, for instance, each part of Aristotle's Physics is called a book. In the unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts</p>
      <p>The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings, or photographs, or such things as crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls. In a physical book, the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines as support for ongoing entries, e.g., an account book, an appointment book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary, or a sketchbook. Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. Books may be distributed in electronic form as e-books and other formats.</p>
